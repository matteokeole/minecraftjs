# Minecraft: JavaScript Edition
### using vanilla JavaScript & THREE.js

Most of the code is made with vanilla JavaScript for a better performance.  
The 3D system uses the library THREE.js.  

The 'game' is available [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/MC) and the HUD indev test can be found [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/MC/hud.html).

**Features:**
+ 3D environment with noise terrain generation & basic movement mechanics
+ Canvas-based interface
+ Inventory container & selectable items
+ Scalable HUD
+ Inverted crosshair
+ Health bar/hunger bar rendering
