# Minecraft clone
### with vanilla JavaScript & THREE.js

Most of the code is made with vanilla JavaScript for a better performance.  
The 3D system uses the library THREE.js.  

The 'game' is available [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/MC) and the HUD indev test can be found [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/MC/hud.html).

+ HUD

  + Experience bar
  + Health bar
  + Hunger bar
  + (soon) Hold item tooltip
