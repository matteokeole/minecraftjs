### Minecraft remake using vanilla JavaScript & THREE.js

Most of the code is made with vanilla JavaScript for a better performance.  
The 3D system uses the library THREE.js.  

The 'game' is available [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/minecraftjs) and the HUD test branch can be found [here](https://matteoo34.github.io/minecraftjs/branch/hud).

**Features:**
+ 3D environment with noise terrain generation & basic movement mechanics
+ Canvas-based interface
+ Inventory container & selectable items
+ Scalable HUD
+ Inverted crosshair
+ Health bar/hunger bar rendering

*Huge thanks to HritikMC for the THREE.js part tutorial. The playlist link is [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEtXCX1lakbhq_01JKJILx90wLfdwrJig) :D*

**Next things to implement:**
+ Text printer revision
+ Layer update() method revision
+ Health/hunger bar animations
+ Items on hotbar
+ Advanced experience bar
+ A more Promise-based code
